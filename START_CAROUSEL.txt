## 🔧 Common Customizations

### 1. Change Product Information
**File**: `js/main.js` (around line 12)
```javascript
const products = [
    {
        name: 'Your Product Name',
        description: 'Your description here',
        price: '$XX.XX',
        emoji: '🧈',
        features: ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2', 'Feature 3']
    },
    // ... more products
];
```

### 2. Change Autoplay Speed
**File**: `js/main.js` (search for `7000`)
```javascript
}, 7000); // Change 7000 to your desired milliseconds
// 5000 = 5 seconds
// 7000 = 7 seconds
// 10000 = 10 seconds
```

### 3. Replace Emojis with Images
**File**: `js/main.js` - Update products array:
```javascript
{
    name: 'Product Name',
    image: 'assets/images/product.jpg', // Add this line
    // ... rest of product
}
```

Then update carousel template to use `<img src>` instead of emoji.

### 4. Change Colors
**File**: `css/styles.css` (top section):
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #D4AF37;     /* Gold - your highlight color */
    --secondary-color: #2C1810;   /* Brown - your text color */
    --accent-color: #F4E4C1;      /* Cream - your background color */
}
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Code

### How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Page Loads**
   - HTML carousel structure appears
   - JavaScript reads your 6 products
   - Creates carousel slides from products

2. **Autoplay Starts**
   - Timer set for 7 seconds
   - Every 7 seconds, shows next product
   - After last product, loops to first

3. **User Interaction**
   - Visitor clicks Previous/Next button
   - Carousel jumps to that product
   - Timer resets for next autoplay
   - Continues rotation

4. **Smooth Transitions**
   - Current product fades out
   - Next product fades in
   - Takes 0.8 seconds
   - CSS handles animation (smooth)

### Files Involved

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | Defines carousel HTML structure |
| `css/styles.css` | Colors, sizes, and styling |
| `css/responsive.css` | Mobile/tablet adjustments |
| `js/main.js` | Autoplay, transitions, interactions |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Carousel Not Showing
**Check**: Is `<div id="productsCarousel"></div>` in HTML?  
**Fix**: Open `index.html`, search for "productsCarousel", should be in products section.

### Autoplay Not Working
**Check**: Is JavaScript enabled? (Usually is)  
**Fix**: Open DevTools (F12), check console for errors.

### Wrong Speed
**Check**: Look for `7000` in `js/main.js`  
**Fix**: Change the number (milliseconds, so 7000 = 7 seconds).

### Mobile Layout Broken
**Check**: Responsive CSS media queries in `responsive.css`  
**Fix**: Test in DevTools mobile view, check breakpoints match.

### Can't Find Where to Change Something
**Fix**: Search the documentation files for that feature.
